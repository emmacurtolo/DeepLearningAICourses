    "So you might be wondering why \n",
    "are we selectively loading product descriptions \n",
    "into the prompt instead of including all of them \n",
    "and letting the model use the information it needs. \n",
    "And so what I mean by this is, why didn't we just include all of \n",
    "this product information in the prompt and we wouldn't have \n",
    "to bother with all of those intermediate steps to actually look up \n",
    "the product information. \n",
    "There's a couple of reasons for this. \n",
    "Firstly, including all of the product descriptions \n",
    "might make the context more confusing \n",
    "for the model just as it would for a person trying to \n",
    "process a large amount of information at once. \n",
    "I will say this is a lot less relevant for \n",
    "more advanced models like GPT-4, especially when the context is well structured \n",
    "like it is in this example and the model is smart enough \n",
    "just to ignore the information that \n",
    "clearly isn't relevant. The next reasons are more compelling. So the \n",
    "second reason is that language models have context limitations, \n",
    "i.e. a fixed number of tokens allowed as input \n",
    "and output. \n",
    "So if you have a large number of products, \n",
    "imagine you had a huge product catalog, you wouldn't even be able to \n",
    "fit all of the descriptions into the context \n",
    "window. \n",
    "And the final reason is that including all \n",
    "of the product descriptions could be expensive as \n",
    "you pay per token when using language models. \n",
    "So by selectively loading information, you can reduce the \n",
    "cost of generating responses. In general, determining when to \n",
    "dynamically load information into the model's context and allowing \n",
    "the model to decide when it needs more information is one of \n",
    "the best ways to augment the capabilities of these models. \n",
    "And to reiterate, you should think of a language model as a \n",
    "reasoning agent that requires the necessary \n",
    "context to draw useful conclusions and \n",
    "perform useful tasks. \n",
    "And so in this case, we had to give the model the product \n",
    "information and then it was able to reason \n",
    "about that product information to create a useful \n",
    "answer for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the models are actually good at deciding when to use a \n",
    "variety of different tools and can use them properly with instructions. \n",
    "And this is the idea behind ChatGPT plugins. \n",
    "We tell the model what tools it has access to and what they do, \n",
    "and it chooses to use them when it needs information from a \n",
    "specific source or wants to take some other appropriate action. \n",
    "In our example, we can only look up information by exact \n",
    "product and category name match, but there are also more advanced \n",
    "techniques for information retrieval. \n",
    "One of the most effective ways to retrieve \n",
    "information is using text embeddings. And embeddings can \n",
    "be used to implement efficient knowledge \n",
    "retrieval over a large corpus to find information related to a given \n",
    "query. \n",
    "One of the key advantages of using text \n",
    "embeddings is that they enable fuzzy or semantic search, \n",
    "which allows you to find relevant information without \n",
    "using the exact keywords. \n",
    "So in our example, we wouldn't necessarily need the exact \n",
    "name of the product, but we could do a more \n",
    "a search with a more general query like a mobile \n",
    "phone. "
